# BioMorocco

## What is BioMorocco

An e-commerce platform, for my portfolio project at the end of their Specializations year at [ALX Software engineers](https://www.alxafrica.com).
It was designed to be the ultimate portfolio project:

This project is developed solely by [WAFI Mohamed](https://github.com/medwf/):

- Using Flask framework to build the backend web application,
- MySQL to store client data.

## What BioMorocco does ?

Morocco is a bioproduct-rich nation, local producers often face challenges in selling and gaining recognition for their goods. That's where BioMrc comes in. Our mission is to bring these beautiful, organic products to our clients, helping small businesses grow while promoting health and well-being. Additionally, our platform eliminates fake products, ensuring that only top-quality bio products are featured.

## Backend

The `README` file for the backend is located in the `BackEnd` folder. It provides detailed information on the backend structure and implementation.
